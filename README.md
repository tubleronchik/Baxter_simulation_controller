# Control Baxter robot with robonomics

Example of how it works is available on [YouTube.][db1]

## Requirements:

 - ROS Melodic + Gazebo (installation manual [here][db2])  
 - extra packages:
```sh
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control ros-melodic-effort-controllers ros-melodic-joint-state-controller
```
- IPFS 0.4.22 (download from [here][db3] and install)
- ipfshttpclient:
```sh
pip install ipfshttpclient
```
 - Robonomics node (binary file) (download latest [release][db4] here)
 - IPFS browser extension (not necessary)

## 1. Download simulation and controller packages
Download packages:
```sh
mkdir -p robot_ws/src
cd robot_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/tubleronchik/Baxter_simulation_controller
mv Baxter_simulation_controller/* ./
rm -rf Baxter_simulation_controller/
cd ..
catkin build
```
Dont forget to add source command:
```sh
echo "source /home/$USER/robot_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## 2. Start simulation
Let's start gazebo world and put our baxter in it:
```sh
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch
```
![empty world][im1]

Open one more window in terminal:
```sh
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file `rospack find baxter_description`/urdf/baxter.urdf -urdf -z 1 -model baxter
```
You can put some models in front of our baxter. It will be more intresting.

## 3.Manage accounts in DAPP

Since we are testing, let us create a local robonomics network with robonomics binary file. Go to folder with robonomics file and run:
```sh
./robonomics --dev --rpc-cors all
```
![robonomics][im3]

Don't forget to remove `db` folder after every launch:
```sh
rm -rf /home/$USER/.local/share/robonomics/chains/dev/db
```

Go to [https://parachain.robonomics.network][db5] and switch to local node
![local node][im4]

Go to Accounts and create __Baxter__ and __Employer__ accounts (__Robot__ is not necessary)

__Important!__ Copy each account's key and address (to copy address click on account's icon). Transfer some money (units) to these accounts:

![create account][im5]
![accounts][im6]

Add Baxter's secret key and adress to `configuration.txt` in `robot_ws/src/robot_controller/src/`

## 4.Start simulation

In new window run:
```sh
ifps init #you only need to do this once
ipfs daemon
```
Open separate terminal and start *controller package*:
```sh
rosrun robot_controller robot_control.py
```
![waiting][im7]

Return to the first terminal, open new window and send command to [**robonomics io**][db6]. This command will turn ON your robot:
```sh
echo "ON" | ./robonomics io write launch -r <CURIOSITY ADDRESS> -s <EMPLOYER’S KEY>
```
Where *<CURIOSITY ADDRESS>* and *<EMPLOYER’S KEY>* are replaced with previously saved strings accordingly

You should see the following:

![working][im9]

when the work is over go to the Robonomics Portal to `Developer > Chain state`. Choose *datalog* in **state query** and add Baxter datalog message using "+" button.

![datalog][im10]

Now the IPFS hash of the telemetry and photos is saved in the blockchain. To see the data simply copy the hash and insert it in IPFS Companion:

Click  __View on Gateway__ and that's all!
